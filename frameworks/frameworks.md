## Frameworks

* The best option is the TensforFlow [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide)
* There is a PyTorch [guide](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/) and a free [book](https://pytorch.org/deep-learning-with-pytorch)

### High level frameworks

* FastAI (v2) [course](https://course.fast.ai/) and [book](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook)
* Keras is merged with TensorFlow now
* there is also MXNet and muon (?) but I don't know those at all, others are basically not used at all
